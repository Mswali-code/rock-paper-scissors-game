# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript. The game allows you to play against the computer and test your decision-making skills.

## How to Play

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. When prompted, enter your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The computer will randomly select its option.
4. The round result will be displayed in the console.
5. Play multiple rounds until the game ends.
6. The final scores and game result will be shown at the end.

## Future Enhancements

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Add a visual interface to enhance the game experience.
- Game Modes: Introduce additional game modes, such as a two-player mode or an advanced AI opponent.
- Scoreboard: Implement a scoreboard to track and display the history of scores and results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Code Structure

The project consists of an HTML file, `index.html`, which serves as the entry point. The game logic is implemented in the JavaScript file, `script.js`. The `script.js` file contains functions to generate the computer's choice, play a single round, and manage the overall game flow.
